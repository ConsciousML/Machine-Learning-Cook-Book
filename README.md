# My Machine Learning Cook Book

## Objective
This repository aims to compile a selection of the most important machine learning concepts.<br/>
The document regrouping this knowledge is not intended to be used to by-pass the reading of serious machine learning books.<br/>
This document should be used as a reminder for the reader to keep in mind the basic mathematical tools to understand and implement most machine learning algorithms.

## Setup
A simple way to compile the latex file and render the pdf is to first install the latex pacakge:
```bash
sudo apt install texlive-latex-extra
```
And then run the following line:
```bash
pdflatex main.tex
```

## Document
A compiled pdf can be found at the root of the project if you just want to read the content without compiling it.

## References
The content of this document is a simplification of various sections of these three book:
- Deep Learning, by A. Courville, Ian Goodfellow, and Yoshua Bengio, 2016.
- Machine Learning: a probabilistic perspective, by K.P. Murphy, 2012.
